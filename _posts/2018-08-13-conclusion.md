title: Conclusion:-
---

So, I **successfully completed my GSoC'18 Project :D**. I had a wonderfull summer doing a really cool project. I learned a lot especially the colloborative work culture, object oriented design skills, colloborating and working using GIT and mainly the in-depth understanding of the various deep learning optimization algorithms, the math behind them etc. 

I need to thank all my mentors at CERN especially [Dr. Stefan Wunch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stwunsch/) and [Dr. Lorenzo Moneta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-moneta-982b902/) for guiding me throughout my journey!

I will continue contributing to ROOT-TMVA project. I really feel proud to be one of the contributors of the great project [ROOT Software framework](https://root.cern/) by CERN.
